I wouldn't bother with 4K for now. The technology is not mature and it is still a very expensive premium, for not much benefit. Not to mention, there isn't much content (except Netflix) which is available in 4K, and even then you need a stonking internet connection.

"Smart TV" is definitely a good thing though. That basically just means that your TV has apps. Often the interface is rubbish though so it might not be worth it. In any case, a dumb TV (like ours) can be made smart by adding a [Chromecast](https://www.google.co.uk/chrome/devices/chromecast/) for only Â£30.
